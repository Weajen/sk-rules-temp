    <h1>The following are a list of rules for all servers on the network and the punishments for breaking them.</h1> 

<li>Many of the punishment lengths are purposefully vague so precedent and staff discretion can be more easily used, allowing staff members to adapt punishments as time goes by, rather than being bound by arbitrary rules created with limited knowledge of the reality they intend to dictate. Words such as “short” and “long” in relation to punishment duration are extremely relative; for example, a “short” punishment for breaking one rule may be a 5 minute mute, while a “short” punishment for a different rule may be a month-long tempban.</li>
<br>
<li><h2>The punishments follow the following general formula:</h2>
    <b>Offense committed: punishment for first offense -> second offense -> … -> nth offense</b></li>

<li>If you see a “«-»”, this means the punishments on either side of that symbol may be used for the same number offense (i.e. first offense, second offense, etc.) depending upon the severity of that offense.</li>
<br>
<li><b>1. Using modded clients - Optifine, Shaders, and other mods which improve game-play are allowed.</b></li>

</li>
<li><b>NOTE 2:</b> Shadow Kingdom staff members are not responsible for any players unaware of changes to this list of server rules, and therefore using that as your alibi to disprove a valid punishment is not permitted. Players and staff members are expected to check the official rules regularly for changes.
