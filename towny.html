        <h1>The following is a list of rules for the Towny server and punishments for breaking them.</h1> 

        <li>Many of the punishment lengths are purposefully vague so precedent and staff discretion can be more easily used, allowing staff members to adapt punishments as time goes by, rather than being bound by arbitrary rules created with limited knowledge of the reality they intend to dictate. Words such as “short” and “long” in relation to punishment duration are extremely relative; for example, a “short” punishment for breaking one rule may be a 5 minute mute, while a “short” punishment for a different rule may be a month-long tempban.</li>
        <br>
        <li><h2>The punishments follow the following general formula:</h2>
        <b>Offense committed: punishment for first offense -> second offense -> … -> nth offense</b></li>
        <li>If you see a “«-»”, this means the punishments on either side of that symbol may be used for the same number offense (i.e. first offense, second offense, etc.) depending upon the severity of that offense.</li>
    <br>
        <li><b>1. Claiming another player's built-on land using Towny.</b>
        - Deletion of your town’s claim(s) in the area + warning -> deletion of your town without refund</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>2. Creating an automatic or "AFK" farm.</b>
            An automatic or “AFK” farm is thus defined: any grinder or farm which produces some item, such as food, items dropped by mob death, etc., that can operate without any input action from a player. This includes any machine designed to bypass the AFK timer. Allowed grinders and semi-automatic farms must have continuous activation by the player (i.e. if the player is not present to activate the machine, it will not grind mobs or farm farms); mob grinders must not fully kill mobs, but can only wound them to the point where one hit from the player, and only the player, can kill them.
            - Warning «-» (if not altered to be in compliance or removed) deletion of the farm without compensation -> tempban
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>3. Creating a death trap for players/teleporting players maliciously in an attempt to instantly kill them/creating an unsafe or deathtrap warp.</b>
            - (if applicable) removal of your warp without refund «-» short tempban -> long tempban
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>4. Major changes to terrain or structures within 80 blocks (5 chunks) of a protected area (e.g. the spawn or player towns) you don't own/belong to.</b>
            Small changes like farming trees or similar are allowed, however, creating mountains, ravines or lava pits without consent is not. It is up to a staff member’s discretion whether an alteration to the area around a town violates this rule.
            - Warning «-» rollback of your terrain edit/build without compensation «-» short tempban -> long tempban
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>5. Malicious destruction or alteration of another player’s owned land within a town.</b>
            - Warning «-» staff will advise the town mayor to remove player from town -> short tempban -> escalate to punishments under Global Rule 16: Harassment (of the community as a whole)
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>6. Spamming the same Auction items multiple times, too high/abusive increment prices or scam auctions.</b>
            Scams could for example be, but are not limited to selling mcMMO ability tools or renamed enchanted books in order to fool inexperienced players
            - Warning -> kick -> short tempban «-» removal of permission to issue command “/auction start” and its variants
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>7. Taking from unlocked chests is allowed, including shulker boxes. However, taking from hoppers and/or potion stands without permission from their owner is not allowed.</b>
            - Warning «-» short tempban -> escalate to punishments under Global Rule 16: Harassment (of the community as a whole)
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>8. PvP is allowed anywhere on the server, where it is enabled. Attempting to bypass pvp toggle by use of lava, CE enchants, or other is not.</b>
            - Warning «-» short tempban -> long tempban
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>9. Town Mayors can make Town-specific rules pertaining to their Town, however, these rules may not interfere with already-existing server rules.</b> Furthermore, the server staff is not required to enforce rules created by Town mayors.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>10. Admins will not return items if you die.</b>

            - Removal of your portal without compensation -> short tempban
            </li>
            <br>
        <li><b>15. Concerning former town members’ items left within town limits:</b>
            <li>- If a player leaves a town of their own volition (e.g. to join a new town), the mayor is not required to return any items left behind. Repeatedly begging staff or the mayor for those items will be treated as Global Rule 8. Repeatedly begging staff or players for goods, services, or actions.
            </li>
            <li>- If a player is kicked due to the 90-day inactivity kick, the remaining chests will be unlocked by a staff member. Open a ticket to contact us. The town mayor is not obligated to return the items after 90 days of inactivity.
            </li>
            <li>- If a player is instead kicked from the town against their will (e.g. by the mayor or the inability to pay taxes), the mayor has to grant them access to their builds/chests/items.
            </li>
            <li>Refusing to give kicked players access to their items can lead to:
                - Warning -> kick «-» short tempban -> long tempban -> possible deletion of the town without compensation
                </li>
        <li><b>16. Abusing LWC protections to lock or block the property of other players:</b>

            </li>
            <br>
       <li><b>17. Creating grinders/mob farms with more than 20 spawners.</b>
        This includes technically separate grinders, that can be used at the same time due to their proximity.
        - Warning -> Removal of the excess spawners without compensation -> short tempban</li>
        <li><h2>*All rules are subject to change at any time.*</h2></li>
        <br>

<li><b>NOTE 1:</b> Staff are the law of the server. If they tell you something is against the rules, stating "that wasn't listed in the rules" or similar is not a valid reason to justify your actions.</li>

<li><b>NOTE 2:</b> Shadow Kingdom staff members are not responsible for any players unaware of changes to this list of server rules, and therefore using that as your alibi to disprove a valid punishment is not permitted. Players and staff members are expected to check the official rules regularly for changes.</li>
